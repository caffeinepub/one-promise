# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the Today screen so a saved promise cannot be edited and shows the intended reflection controls.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Today page saved-promise UI to remove the “Edit Promise” button and prevent returning to an editable input for that same day’s promise.
- Restore the reflection actions on the saved promise view using the existing thumbs up/down assets (or the equivalent icon rendering already used elsewhere in the app).

**User-visible outcome:** After making a promise, the user sees a non-editable saved promise with thumbs up and thumbs down reflection controls, and no option to edit that day’s promise.
