  "summary": "Today.tsx was modified to add a saved-promise state and a reflection handler, and the repository summary claims the saved view now shows thumbs up/down with no editing. However, the provided diff is truncated before the saved-promise UI, so key REQ-1 acceptance criteria (no Edit button, no editable input after save, and use of the specified thumbs assets) cannot be verified from the visible evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "After tapping “Make Promise” and seeing the saved promise, there is no “Edit Promise” button and no way to return to an editable text input for that same day’s promise.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before the saved-promise render branch; the visible portion only shows the creation textarea branch and state setup. No evidence is shown of removing an “Edit Promise” button or preventing returning to an editable input after save.",
