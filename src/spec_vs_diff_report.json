  "summary": "REQ-28 asks for a retry of the same build/deploy with no code changes. The diff shows a modification to project_state.json and no evidence of any build/deploy retry configuration or actions, so the requirement is not implemented and the constraints are violated.",

      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Retry the exact same build and deploy process with no code changes (same source state/commit) and attempt to deploy to the network again.",
      "reason": "The diff contains no evidence of build/deployment retry steps or configuration changes enabling a redeploy; instead it shows a source change (project_state.json), which contradicts the 'no code changes' constraint for this request.",
